This blog is built through the [**Radix**](https://rstudio.github.io/radix) framework for scientific publishing. I use it to communicate the statistical programming work I do with fewer restrictions. Wix is great for making pretty websites, but not for sharing code. You can learn more about me at [**my website.**](https://jbixon13.wixsite.com/website)

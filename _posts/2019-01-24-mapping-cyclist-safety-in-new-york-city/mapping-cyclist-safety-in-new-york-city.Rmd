I was inspired by this [**CityLab**](https://www.citylab.com/perspective/2018/12/new-york-city-electric-bikes-transit-crisis-de-blasio/577969/) article detailing the impending transportation crisis due to the MTA L Line shutdown. Specifically, I am interested in observing whether the shutdown contributes to an increase in cyclist injuries due to motor vehicle collisions as about [**275,000 L Line riders**](https://ny.curbed.com/2018/10/3/17925038/nyc-subway-l-train-shutdown-mitigation-alternatives) seek alternatives.  
  
[**NYC DOT**](http://web.mta.info/sandy/CanarsieTunnelRebuildingProcess.html#sdtr) has predicted about 2% of L Line riders to switch to cycling, while about 79% are predicted to move to other subway lines. I could investigate the dispersion of L Train riders to other options as a whole if data is available, but for now I will focus on cyclist safety as it's more approachable with currently available data.    

***  
### Let's start by looking at some performance metrics for the MTA subway network as a whole.   
Some of the performance metric definitions are opaque, so I'll [**specify where necessary.**](http://dashboard.mta.info/)  


### Now let's look at some two-wheeled data.   

```{r echo=FALSE}
# convert date to a date variable
NYPD$DATE <- NYPD$DATE %>% 
  substr(start = 1, stop = 10) %>% 
  ymd()

# create summarized subset of NYPD data 
sub <- NYPD 

# summarize by week
sub <- sub %>% 
  filter(DATE > 16438) %>% 
  mutate(week = floor_date(DATE, 'weeks', week_start = 7)) %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarize(cyclist_injuries = sum(`NUMBER OF CYCLIST INJURED`))

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
# plot cyclist injuries per week 
plt.sub <- sub %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = cyclist_injuries)) +
  geom_point(color = 'steelblue4', alpha = .7) + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm') + 
  xlab('Week') +
  ylab('Cyclist Injuries Per Week') + 
  theme_classic()

# convert to plotly object
ggplotly(plt.sub) %>% 
  layout(title = 'Cyclist injuries due to vehicle collisions are increasing.',
  titlefont = list(size = 16)) %>%
  config(displayModeBar = FALSE)
```

### And now a map of cyclist injuries and deaths over the last few years.   

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
# read in shapefile
bike_network <- readOGR(dsn = 'data/20180906_current_bike_network', layer = '20180906_current_bike_network')

# convert to sf and transform to web map projection  
bike_network <- st_as_sf(bike_network)
bike_network_trans <- st_transform(bike_network, 4326)

bike_network_trans <- bike_network_trans %>% 
  mutate(labs = paste0('<strong>Street: </strong>', street,
                       '<br><strong>Installed: </strong>', instdate,
    '<br><strong>Modified: </strong>', moddate,
    '<br><strong>Lanes: </strong>', lanecount,
    '<br><strong>Path Type Endpoint: </strong>', ft_facilit,
    '<br><strong>Path Type Startpoint: </strong>', tf_facilit))

labs <- as.list(bike_network_trans$labs)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, layout='l-screen-inset', fig.height=5}

### Planned Updates / Notes:    

This is an ongoing project that I am doing in my free time. If you have any constructive criticism please feel free to reach out, especially with suggestions about spatial regression methodology.  

* Methodology
    + Need a way to do geospatial predictive modeling with a dataset that only has 1s, no 0s
    + How to understand relationship between accidents when we only have accident data, not non-accidents
    + Consider using Citibike data as a proxy to cyclist population, but do they behave differently?
    + Look into spatial prediction methods (spatial autocorrelation, spatial regression, etc.)
    + What trends are there in types of bike paths being constructed over time?
* Time-Series
    + More rigorous analysis of cyclist injuries
    + Use ARIMA model to remove seasonality, conclude whether injuries are increasing
    + Are injuries increasing because more people are biking or something else?    
* Geospatial
    + Consider changing map to chloropleths (and use accidents per capita)
    + Find a way to visualize changes over time, whether through leaflet or gganimate or otherwise
    + Need function that can calculate a point's (accident) nearest polyline (bike path) and return features (type of path)  
* Visualizations
    + Change drag behavior (for mobile) when [**plotly**](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly) is updated to 1.43

#
